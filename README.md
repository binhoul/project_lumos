### Overview
This site aims to be a central repository for open source knowledge resources. It was built with the goals of helping those people who want to learn things but are clueless where to start and feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources available on the Internet.

### Reasons for building it
The site's primary objective was to list out the knowledge resources for the students present in my undergrad college. The goal of the site was to be a starting point and pique their interests in technical education and/or enhancement of soft skills thus providing them with skill sets suitable for seeking employment. 

### Technical Specifications
* The site was built using [Django](https://github.com/django/django) and [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI)
* It is hosted on a free tier at [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)

##### The site is located at [projectlumos.pythonnywhere.com](projectlumos.pythonnywhere.com)
